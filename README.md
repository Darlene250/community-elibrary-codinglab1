# Library Management System (Python CLI Project)

## Project Overview

This is a simple **Library Management System** built with Python and used through the **Command Line Interface (CLI)**. It allows two types of users:
-  **Students**: Can search for books and borrow them
-  **Admins**: Can add books and manage the library

This was created as a final project for a Python course to practice working with:
- Python functions
- Classes
- File handling (reading/writing to files)
- Command line interaction
- Unit testing with `unittest`
